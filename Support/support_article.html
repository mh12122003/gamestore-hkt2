            <div id="box">
            <p>It's super-easy. First, you need to add the game to your cart. You can do it in two places: <br>

                - The catalog page, by clicking on the game's price, or <br>
                - The product page (like this one), by clicking on the "Add to Cart" button. <br>
                
                Once you've got one or more items in your Cart, click on the Cart icon in the upper-right corner of the screen, and select "Checkout Now". You can also do this from the product page (where the "Add to Cart" button will be replaced by "Checkout Now"). <br>
                
                Once in Checkout, you will have to select your payment method (credit card, PayPal etc.) and, after all data is entered, click on "Pay for your order now".</p>
